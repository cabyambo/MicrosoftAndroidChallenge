The Submit switches between enabled/disaebled in real time depending on if there is valid input in the text boxes.

I have added some input verification. 
1. Any name is allowed to be passed.
2. The email must be a valid email.
3. The password must be an arbitrary length of 1 or more.
4. No website is required, but if a website is entered, it must be a valid URL.
